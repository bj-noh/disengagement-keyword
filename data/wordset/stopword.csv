"The AV Test Driver took control from the autonomous system due to undesirable lane placement.  AV Test Drivers consider various factors, including the amount of traffic and the behavior of any surrounding vehicles. In addition to their own perception, an in-vehicle display provides input on the vehicle's lane placement.  Also incorporated is an advanced system for fluid exchange between the driver and the system without the need for buttons or switches.  This allows the AV Test Drivers to take control to provide a transitory adjustment."
